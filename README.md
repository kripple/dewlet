# Dewlet

One day, this multi-platform application will be used to water plants. For now, it is being used to help this Author learn more about React Native.

## How To Dew

Follow along here: https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app

1. `npm install create-expo-app --save-dev`
2. `npx create-expo-app dewlet`
3. Move the code up a level, replace the README, and remove that one line from vscode settings that rudely deletes content from your files on-save.
4. `npm run reset-project` (and remove reset-project script from package.json)

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
